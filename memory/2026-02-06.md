- User reminded me that I am running on GitHub Codespaces.
- My project path is `/home/codespace/.openclaw/workspace`.
- User mentioned the path as `/workspace/openclaw`, which is a bit different from my actual workspace path. It's the root of the codespace project, but my agent workspace is nested inside `.openclaw`. I'll rely on my internal path but keep the user's context in mind.
\n- User specified the project tech stack: Next.js (React), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
\n- GitHub repo is https://github.com/tungyi/openclaw.git. I must push changes to the repo after completing coding tasks.
\n- The public URL for this Codespace chat is https://ominous-space-doodle-x557gjv6pjjc6r74-18789.app.github.dev/chat?session=main
\n- Standing order: After development, I must run the frontend project, ensure its port doesn't conflict with existing forwarded ports (like 18789), and send the public URL for the running project to the user.
